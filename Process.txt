Since, /usr directory is hidden by default on Mac OSX.

Open Finder.
Click Go on menu bar then click Go to folder or Press Command+Shift+G directly.
Enter the path /usr/local/include
Now proceed as mentioned above.
(UPDATE: For latest OS X you need to make folder include inside local and make bits folder inside include folder and then copy paste the code inside bits folder.)
